This is a simple coffee website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It serves as a front-end-only demo for a fictional coffee shop, offering a clean, modern design and responsive layout for all devices. The website includes multiple sections such as:

Home – A welcoming hero section with branding.

About – Information about the coffee shop.

Menu – Showcase of popular drinks or products.

Contact – Basic contact form or business details.

The project is aimed at improving front-end development skills and demonstrating how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript can be used to create a visually appealing, user-friendly website without using any frameworks or libraries.
